# Product Guidelines - Horde Forged

## Tone and Style
**Tone**: Grimdark fantasy—echoing hammers, goo drips, undead moans. Heroes' banter: "Another fool's gold... or my fortune?" The narrative will unfold via runs, revealing the corruption saga of the Volgrim Crucible.

## Brand Messaging
The brand messaging will emphasize the roguelite horde survival, rune-forged RPG progression, and mobile perfection with 1-thumb controls. It will highlight the power fantasy, dopamine loops from rapid progression and loot, and thematic immersion in a dwarven decay setting.

## Visual Identity
**Art Style**: 16-32px Top-Down Pixel Art (NES/SNES-inspired, crisp scaling).
**Visuals** (16px base, 4x upscale):
- Heroes: Silhouetted sprites (idle animations: rune glows).
- Ruins: Volcanic stone, goo veins (purple ooze), rusted gears.
- Effects: Particle bursts (crystals shatter), Synergy fuses (sparks merge icons).
- Dynamic: Fog of Blight (screen edges); Lighting from forges.

## Audio Design
**Audio**:
- SFX: Hammer thuds, goo squelch, crystal chimes (haptic sync).
- Music: Chiptune-orchestral (tense build → epic crescendo).
- Voice: Dwarven grunts; Priest whispers ("Impure... eternal!").

## Content Guidelines
All in-game content, including text, art, and sound, must align with the grimdark fantasy tone and thematic immersion of dwarven decay and corruption. Lore consistency, particularly around the Volgrim Crucible, Impure Adamantium, and the Blight Essence, is paramount. Accessibility features like auto-vacuum toggle, slow-mo, and big touch zones should be maintained.
