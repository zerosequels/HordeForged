# Product Guide - Horde Forged

## Initial Concept
**Elevator Pitch**: In *Horde Forged*, play as customizable adventurers delving the infested **Volgrim Crucible**—ancient dwarven forges corrupted by impure adamantium. Auto-clear undead hordes and clockwork abominations with levelable Active & Passive Skills, stack Magic Items for synergies, and survive escalating waves in 12-minute roguelite runs. Fuse *Vampire Survivors* passive escalation, *Risk of Rain 2* item stacking, and *MegaBonk* loot rushes into a thumb-friendly mobile RPG: Move, forge, dominate.

## Vision
To deliver a high-adrenaline, roguelite horde survival RPG that provides a powerful sense of progression and a deep meta-game for mobile players, perfect for short, intense play sessions.

## Target Audience
